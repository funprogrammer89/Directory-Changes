# directoryChanges
Check for file changes in a directory by using a files.json file to save the state of a directory.

Only tested on Windows OS.

First run setjosn.py, then use compare.py to compare directory state changes against the JSON file that setjson creates.

Code may not run properly in VScode output, not sure why this is but probably has something to do with the colored text being outputted to the terminal.

Suggest running code from cmd line / terminal or PyCharm.
